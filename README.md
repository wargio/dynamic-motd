# Dynamic motd

The aim of this project is to give some informations when you log into a server through SSH.

Example:

```

   ___  ___ _ ____   _____ _ __
  / __|/ _ \ '__\ \ / / _ \ '__|
  \__ \  __/ |   \ V /  __/ |
  |___/\___|_|    \_/ \___|_|

**Warning** This Debian and Debian-related distributions only.

## Dependencies

You need to install some packages:

```
apt-get install figlet lsb-release python3-utmp
```

Optionnally, you can install `needrestart` which is used to show a message if your server need a reboot (main reason (and the only one I know): you have upgraded your kernel).
If you don't install `needrestart`, it will work, but you won't be warned about the need for a reboot.
`needrestart` warns you about services that need to be restarted too (but is slower than `checkrestart` for that, see below).

You can optionnally install `debian-goodies` which provides `checkrestart`, which will be used to warn you about services that need to be restarted. Relying on `needrestart` for that is slow (Â±7 seconds) while `checkrestart` do it faster (less than one second).

## Installation

```
cp -rv update-motd.d/ /etc/
chmod -v 755 /etc/update-motd.d/
chmod -v 644 /etc/update-motd.d/colors /etc/update-motd.d/sysinfo.py
rm -rfv /etc/motd
ln -sv /var/run/motd /etc/motd
```

## Salt

You will find a working salt formula in `init.sls`.

```
cd /srv/salt
git clone https://framagit.org/luc/dynamic-motd.git motd
salt your_server state.sls motd
```
